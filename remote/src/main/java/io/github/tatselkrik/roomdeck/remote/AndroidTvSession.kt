    // Why not the canonical Python `start=end=len(newText)-1` shape?
    // That shape is documented as "set field to value with cursor at
    // len-1" but the wild firmware actually interprets it as a literal
    // span insert at position len-1, so progressive sends compound:
    //   send "h" into "":  insert at 0 → "h"          ✓
    //   send "he" into "h": insert at 1 → "h"+"he" = "hhe"  ✗
    //   send "hel" into "hhe": insert at 2 → "hh"+"hel"+"e" = "hhhele" ✗
    // A full-range replacement [0..prev.length] unambiguously rewrites
    // the field on this firmware. Canonical Python gets away with the
    // len-1 shape because it's intended as a one-shot send into an
    // empty field; our progressive on-screen-keyboard usage breaks it.
    //
    // Counters: both ime_counter and field_counter ride on every frame.
    // Per canonical Python, neither is ever bumped by the sender — they
    // ratchet up via TV echoes only and stay at 0 until the first echo.
    //
    // Empty `newText` is a legitimate "clear the field" delete (the
    // Backspace button shortens to empty); the wire shape stays valid
    // because `start=0, end=prev.length, value=""` encodes cleanly.
